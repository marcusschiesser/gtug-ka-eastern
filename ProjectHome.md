As a result of the hackathon on 30th January of the GTUG Karlsruhe, we built a mobile geocaching game with a nice Eastern topic.

Here are the game rules:

Grab your iphone or android mobile, start the app and use the provided map to
find eastern eggs in your surrounding area.

If you come to the proximity of an egg, you get a hint for better finding the egg.
After finding the egg (don't cheat!) you may leave a tag for other finders.

There's no egg in your neighborhood? Then place one yourself!
Just start the app, take a egg and a marker pen and find a nice cache for your egg.
Inform the app that you are about to hide an egg, you will receive a unique ID (called Ei-D) that you write on the egg (of course you may also color the egg beforehand!).
Then hide the egg and leave a hint so other people are able to find the egg.

You may also scroll the map and find other eggs people left in other cities.
